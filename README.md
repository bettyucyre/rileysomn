# How to Get Unbanned on Ring of Elysium (2025 Guide) 🎯

Getting banned from Ring of Elysium can be super annoying, especially if you’re pretty sure you didn’t do anything wrong. This easy-to-follow guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned, and how to appeal smartly to increase your chances of returning to the snowy (or tropical) battlegrounds.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned the second you slapped together a new account? Or maybe the ban follows you no matter how many fresh accounts you create? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Ring of Elysium has flagged your PC hardware, so no matter how many new accounts you make, you’re still blocked from playing.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your emails or any in-game notifications from Ring of Elysium or Garena (depending on your region) to find out why you got the boot. Most common reasons include:  
- Using cheats or third-party hacks  
- Toxic or abusive behavior  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious login activity  

**Pro tip:** Make sure you skim through the Garena or Ring of Elysium Terms of Service before you hit that appeal button.
