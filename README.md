<p>Did you get banned the second you slapped together a new account? Or maybe the ban follows you no matter how many fresh accounts you create? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Ring of Elysium has flagged your PC hardware, so no matter how many new accounts you make, you’re still blocked from playing.</p>
